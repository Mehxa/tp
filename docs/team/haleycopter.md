### Project: Big Brother

Big Brother is a desktop address book application used for managing employee details by HR Staff of a startup. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability `undo` the address book to the immediate previous state once, provided the previous state was the result of a data-modifying command.
  * What it does: allows the user to restore the address book to the immediate previous state.
  * Justification: This feature improves user to recover from scary mistakes like running `clear` when they intended to run `delete` instead.
  * Highlights: This required the address book to store the previous state for data-modifying commands (`delete`, `clear`, `sort`, `add`, `edit`, `cert-add`, `cert-edit`, `cert-del`, `tag`).
  * Credits: the `undo` command has some references to the proposed `undo` command in default AB3.*

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoCommand.java)
